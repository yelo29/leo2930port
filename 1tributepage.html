      <h2>About José Rizal</h2>
      <p>
        José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1861–1896) was a Filipino nationalist,
        novelist, ophthalmologist, and polymath whose writings inspired the Philippine
        nationalist movement. He authored key works that criticized colonial rule and argued
        for reform through education and civic engagement rather than violent revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rizal travelled extensively, studied medicine and languages, and used his pen to
        awaken Filipino identity. His legacy remains central to Philippine history and
        civic education.
